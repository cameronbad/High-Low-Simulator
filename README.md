# High-Low-Simulator
A simulator which runs through a higher or lower card game by always choosing the best decision, does this multiple times to find the average result over games, and then records it. Number of games simulated is editable in the run program.
The detailed version logs most if not all of the codes actions whereas the minimal version only shows the essentials so as to reduce clutter.
